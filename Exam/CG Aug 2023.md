QUESTION 1: (30 Marks)
a) Distinguish between the following terms 
i. Emissive and non-emissive displays  (2 marks)
ii. Image processing and image synthesis (2 marks)
iii. Interlacing scan and progressive scan (2 marks)

b) Suppose RGB raster system is to be designed using an 12 inch X 20 inch screen with a resolution of 100 pixels per inch in each direction. If we want to store 6 bits per pixel in the frame buffer, how much storage (in kilobytes) do we need for frame buffer? (4 marks)

c) Identify and explain three types of Geometric primitives used in OpenGL (3 marks)

d) A point has coordinates in the following coordinates D(5, 6, 7). The translation is done in the x and y -direction by 3 three coordinates and in the z-direction by two coordinates. Find coordinates of the new position (4 marks)

e) Explain three factors you would consider before selecting a display technology (4marks) 

f) Briefly Discuss the basic principles in displaying polygons under OpenGL (3 marks)

g) Describe the steps to be followed in Digital Differential Analyzer scan conversion algorithm. (6 Marks)


Question 2: (15 Marks)
a) Clipping is an important concept used in computer graphics and computer vision. In this context:
i. Define clipping. (1 Mark)
ii. Highlight any FOUR types of clipping. (4 Marks)
b) Digitize the line with endpoints (20, 10) and (30, 18) using Bresenham's Line Drawing algorithm and provide the sketch for the resulting pixels. (10 Marks)

Question 3: (15 Marks)
a)An openGL callback function is different from a normal function as it is never called directly by the application.
i) Briefly Explain the purpose of the glutDisplay Func() call back function. (2 Marks)

ii) Write a program to demonstrate how the glutDisplay Func() call back function is used in openGL programs. (8 Marks)


b) Study the OpenGL code snippet below and sketch the graphic that will render when executed.

glBegin(GL_TRIANGLE STRIP); 
glColor3f(1,1,1); // color 
glVertex2f(0,0); //vl 
glVertex2f(0, 1); //v2
glVertex2f(1,0); //v3
glVertex2f(1,1); // v4
glVertex2f(2,0); //v5
glEnd():

Question 4: (15 Marks)
a) Rotate a line CD whose endpoints are (3, 4) and (12, 15) about origin through a 45Â° anticlockwise direction (6marks)

b) Consider two raster systems with the resolutions of 1280 x 720 and 2048 x 1536.
i. How many pixels could be accessed per second in each of these systems by a display controller with a refresh rate of 120Hz? (2 marks)

ii. What is the access time per pixel in each system? (2 marks)

c) Describe the architecture of a virtual reality system. (5 marks)
